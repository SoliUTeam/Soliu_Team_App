## How to add or edit question

test question consist with two different files  **testData.json** and **testQuestion(n).json**

### testData.json

 this file contains basic information of test section. e.g thumbImage, title, color, testNumber

**testNumber** is important for matching with exact testQuestion file. We can easily track the test Question in the future with testNumber (e.g sorting the test with testNumber for different condition test questions)

e.g testNumber is 10, then that certain test section is relate with **testQuestion10.json** file



### testQuestion(n).json

  n stands for number.
